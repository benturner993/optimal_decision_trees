## Objective

Review the performance of optimal decision trees by comparing this method with alternatives (GLM and XGBoost).

## Contents
This repository contains:

- *data* - datasets for the analysis
- *evaluation* - summary statistics
- *glm* - code to build model 
- *img* - images
- *notebooks* - workings for learning and development
- *optimal_decision_trees* - code to build model
- *outputs* - results
- *xgb* - code to build model

## Future Developments
Developments to investigate / consider:

- additional feature engineering steps, e.g. frequency binning
